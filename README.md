Lab report creation app with Blazor Server

This app is a demo of a Laboratory Information Management System inspired by my previous job at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture.
Create reports, add samples to be analyzed, assign lab tests, enter measurement data, finalize and print.
Made with .NET 5.0, BlazorServer, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, and hosted on Azure.
