<h4>About This App</h4>

<p>The Plant/Waste/Solution/Media Lab is a section of the Agronomic Division
   of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The lab 
   performs nutrient analysis on several types of agricultural samples and provides
   recommendations on how best to improve crop production or manage environmental
   quality. The types of samples analyzed include:</p>

   <ul>
       <li>Crop leaf tissues (tomato, corn, lettuce, cabbage, etc.)</li>
       <li>Animal waste to be used as fertilizer (dairy cow manure, hog lagoons)</li>
       <li>Composted materials</li>
       <li>Industrial byproducts (coal ash, paper waste)</li>
       <li>Water-based solutions (irrigation water, fish ponds, hydroponic nutrient solutions)</li>
       <li>Soilless potting media</li>
   </ul>

<p>The lab analyzes around 35,000 samples per year, submitted by various types of customers,
    including:
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Individual farmers and gardeners from all over North Carolina</li>
        <li>Agricultural consultants who provide services to large numbers of growers</li>
        <li>Academic and corporate researchers conducting controlled trials for publication or internal purposes</li>
        <li>Extension agents and NCDA agronomists providing state-funded support to the public</li>
    </ul>

<p>This app is an independent personal project. The real NCDA & CS division website

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>To create a <a href="">new report</a>, choose a sample type and a report type, then pick
    a particular crop name or sample code and the number of samples. Click "Create Grid"
    and the sample rows will appear below. Unique lab IDs for the report and samples will be
    automatically generated.
    Within the sample rows, you can change crop type, edit tests assigned, and add comments.
    Rows can be duplicated or deleted. When finished editing, click "Save Report to Worklist."
    (You will need to be logged in, try logging in with "user" and "userpass" if you haven't already
    done so.)
</p>

<p>In the <a href="Worklist">worklist</a>, values for assigned tests can be entered directly and are automatically
    saved in the database. If ICP or Heavy Metals tests are assigned, an "O" will appear for an
    incomplete entry. Fill in the data by going to the ICP and HM pages and entering values
    manually or clicking "Read Data from Instrument" (this generates random values and simulates
    reading the data directly from the instrument in the lab.) Again, all values are instantly saved.
    Back in the worklist, an "X" will appear for completed ICP and HM tests.
</p>
<p>When all values for assigned tests have been entered, the report can be finalized.
    Click on the blue word "Finalized" to remove that report from the worklist. You can
    now add customer information and any final comment from the agronomist. The measured data
    is displayed both as raw values and as a standardized sufficiency rating. Deficient (D) values are
    colored blue and excessive (E) values are colored red. Low (L), Sufficient (S) and High (H)
    are colored green. After clicking "Finish Report", a printable version will be accessible from
    the <a href="ReportFinal">Report Finalization</a> page.
</p>

<h4>Admin Functions</h4>

<p>Users who are logged in with admin privileges (try using "admin" and "adminpass") can 
    create new types of samples, edit reference data, and add new registered users manually.
    After logging in, click the newly visible links in the navigation menu on the left side
    of the page.
</p>
<p>
    Admins can also clear out the report database by going to the bottom of the worklist and
    clicking "Delete All Reports". This will remove all saved reports and samples from the
    database. Keep in mind, this action is irreversible...
